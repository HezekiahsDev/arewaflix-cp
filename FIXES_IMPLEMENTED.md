## ✅ Completed Fixes (Phase 1 - Critical)

### 1. ✅ Privacy Policy & Terms of Service Links

**Issue:** Non-functional links referenced in signup  
**Status:** FIXED ✅

**Changes Made:**

- ✅ Added functional links using `expo-web-browser` in:
  - `app/auth/signup.tsx` - Terms/Privacy in consent checkbox
  - `app/auth/login.tsx` - Terms/Privacy in footer
  - `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` - Terms/Privacy links in footer
- ✅ Updated `app.json` with iOS permission descriptions

**Files Modified:**

### 2. ✅ Account Deletion Feature

**Issue:** No way to delete account (Apple Guideline 5.1.1(v) violation)  
**Status:** FIXED ✅

**Changes Made:**

- ✅ Added `deleteAccount()` API function in `lib/api/auth.ts`
- ✅ Added "Delete Account" button in profile screen
- ✅ Implemented two-step confirmation dialog
- ✅ Calls `DELETE /api/v1/users/me` with Bearer token
- ✅ Clears local auth state and redirects to home on success
- ✅ Shows clear warning about permanent data deletion

**API Endpoint Required (Backend):**

```
DELETE /api/v1/users/me
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

**Files Modified:**

- `lib/api/auth.ts` - Added `deleteAccount()` function
- `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` - Added UI and handlers

**⚠️ Backend Action Required:**
Your backend team must implement the DELETE endpoint that:

- Returns success/error response
- Optionally sends confirmation email

### 3. ✅ Removed Non-Functional Social Login Buttons

**Issue:** 6 social login buttons that did nothing (App Completeness violation)

- ✅ Removed `handleSocialLogin()` function
- ✅ Added Privacy & Terms footer instead
- ✅ Cleaner, more honest UI

**Files Modified:**

- `app/auth/login.tsx` - Removed social login section

**Future Enhancement:**
If you want to add social login later, you must implement:

- Sign in with Apple (required if other social logins exist on iOS)
- OAuth flows for Google, Facebook, etc.

---
