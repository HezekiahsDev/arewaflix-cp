    <h1>ArewaFlix Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><small>Last Updated: January 2, 2026</small></p>

    <p>
      ArewaFlix ("we", "our", or "us") is a movie streaming platform run by
      Abnur Entertainment. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use,
      disclose, and protect your information when you use our services.
    </p>

    <p>
      By accessing ArewaFlix, you agree to the collection and use of information
      according to this Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We may collect the following types of personal and technical data:</p>

    <h3>1.1 Personal Information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Full Name</li>
      <li>Email Address</li>
      <li>Phone Number</li>
      <li>Gender</li>
      <li>Profile photo (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Automatically Collected Data</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Device information (model, OS version)</li>
      <li>IP address</li>
      <li>App usage analytics</li>
      <li>Streaming performance metrics (e.g., buffering, network speed)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Content Interaction</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Movies watched or downloaded</li>
      <li>Search history</li>
      <li>User preference selections</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.4 Device Identifiers and Fingerprinting</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>What we collect:</strong> We may generate and store a persistent,
      installation-specific device fingerprint composed of
      non-personally-identifying device attributes (for example: platform, OS
      version, and an installation identifier provided by the runtime) combined
      with a random installation-specific suffix. We may also collect the Expo
      push token (when you opt in to push notifications) and other device
      identifiers needed to deliver services.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Android Advertising ID (AAID):</strong> We collect the Android
      Advertising ID (a user-resettable identifier provided by Google) solely to
      detect and prevent fraud, ensure one account per device, and for other
      security and service‑operation purposes (for example, account integrity,
      abuse detection, and debugging). We do NOT use the AAID for advertising,
      personalization of ads, or cross‑app tracking, and we do not share the raw
      AAID with advertisers. Where we share identifiers with vendors (push
      delivery, analytics, or fraud detection), we only share hashed or
      pseudonymized identifiers and only when required to provide the service.
      Users can reset or limit use of the AAID via their device settings
      (Settings → Google → Ads → Reset advertising ID / Opt out of Ads
      Personalization).
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>iOS (IDFA / ATT):</strong> On iOS we follow Apple's App Tracking
      Transparency (ATT) framework. We only read the Identifier for Advertisers
      (IDFA) after a user grants tracking permission. If a user denies tracking,
      the IDFA will not be available and we will not use it for tracking or
      advertising.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Why we collect it:</strong> Device identifiers and fingerprints
      are used solely for service operation purposes such as fraud prevention
      (to detect duplicated or automated accounts and views), improving service
      reliability, and delivering push notifications. We do NOT use the
      fingerprint for advertising or cross-app tracking unless we obtain your
      explicit consent.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Storage and protection:</strong> Fingerprints are stored locally
      in the app and may be transmitted to our servers for the limited purposes
      described above. We protect this data using industry-standard measures.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the data we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and maintain our service</li>
      <li>Manage user accounts and subscriptions</li>
      <li>Improve streaming performance and content recommendations</li>
      <li>Detect and prevent fraud and unauthorized access</li>
      <li>Send notifications about new content, updates, or offers</li>
      <li>Comply with legal and regulatory requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>Push notifications:</strong> If you permit push notifications, we
      collect and use an Expo push token to deliver notifications to your
      device. We will only register and send push tokens if you have granted
      permission via the device OS prompt and (where implemented) your in-app
      notification preference. You can disable push notifications at any time
      via your device settings or the app's notification controls.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell personal information.</p>

    <p><strong>Who we share data with</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Service providers required to operate the service: cloud hosting,
        content delivery (CDN), and payment processors (e.g., Airtime, DCB/DST,
        card payments). These providers process data on our behalf and under our
        instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Push delivery providers and notification platforms only when you opt in
        to push notifications (we send the Expo push token so messages can be
        delivered to your device).
      </li>
      <li>Regulatory bodies, when required by law.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We do not embed or rely on third-party content providers for video hosting
      or content moderation — all content available in the app is published and
      managed by ArewaFlix. We may share aggregated or pseudonymized analytics
      (for example, view counts) with partners for reporting purposes but we do
      not sell personal data.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Device identifiers sharing:</strong> We may share hashed or
      pseudonymized device identifiers with third-party providers that operate
      on our behalf (for push delivery, analytics, or fraud-detection). We do
      not share raw device identifiers for advertising or cross-app tracking
      without your explicit consent.
    </p>

    <h2>4. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Your data may be processed on servers outside your country. We apply
      safeguards compliant with applicable data protection laws (e.g., Standard
      Contractual Clauses) to protect your rights.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>We use industry-standard encryption:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>TLS for data in transit</li>
      <li>Encrypted databases for data at rest</li>
      <li>Regular server audits and intrusion detection</li>
      <li>Strict access control and monitoring</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While we strive to protect your data, no system is completely secure.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We keep your information only as long as necessary for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Service delivery</li>
      <li>Legal, regulatory, and accounting obligations</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>Device identifiers and analytics:</strong> By default, device
      fingerprints and related analytics data are retained for up to 12 months
      to support fraud prevention and service operations. Where you request
      deletion of your account or personal data, we will delete identifiers tied
      to your account within 30 days unless retention is required for legal
      reasons.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      ArewaFlix is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly
      collect data from minors below this age.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access your data</li>
      <li>Correct or update information</li>
      <li>Request deletion</li>
      <li>Restrict or object to processing</li>
      <li>Withdraw consent at any time</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>To exercise these rights, contact us at:</strong></p>
    <pre>privacy@arewaflix.com</pre>

    <p><strong>Your Choices</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Disable push notifications:</strong> Turn off notifications for
        Arewaflix in your device settings or use the app's notification
        controls.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Delete account and data:</strong> Request account deletion via
        support or privacy@arewaflix.com. We will remove associated identifiers
        as described in the Retention section.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reset or limit AAID:</strong> On Android, you can reset or opt
        out of Ads Personalization in Settings → Google → Ads → Reset
        advertising ID / Opt out of Ads Personalization.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Revoke tracking on iOS:</strong> On iOS go to Settings → Privacy
        → Tracking and toggle off tracking for apps.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      We do not use cookies in the ArewaFlix mobile app. The app does use local
      storage and device identifiers internally to support features such as
      remembering your session, counting video views, and supporting analytics.
      When used, device identifiers are pseudonymized and used for analytics
      (for example, counting views per video) and fraud prevention. You can
      control tracking and analytics in the app's Privacy settings when
      available or via your device settings.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Links to Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      We do not embed third-party content or services inside the ArewaFlix app.
      All primary content is regulated and published by ArewaFlix. If we include
      external links (for example, to support resources), they will be clearly
      labeled; such links are not used for tracking or analytics purposes by
      default and are outside the scope of this policy.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect operational or regulatory
      changes. Updates will be posted with a new "Last Updated" date.
    </p>
